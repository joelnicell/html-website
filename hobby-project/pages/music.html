        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>Music is one my main passions, with my interests spanning multiple genres and disciplines.</p>

            <h2>Piano</h2>
            <p>I've played piano since I was 8 years old. I grew up learning classical, until I went to unversity, where I studied Jazz piano</p>
            <p>Since then, I've shifted my focus towards creating meditative compositions. I'm inspired by pianists / composers such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>

            <h2>Production</h2>
            <p>I produce and engineer EDM, electronic, pop and RnB music. What started as a hobby turned into a job during covid.</p>
            <p>During lockdown, I took the time and opportunity to turn my room into a studio. This included:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Measuring the acoustics of the room</li>
                <li>Researching and buying soundproof material</li>
                <li>Installing fixtures in my room</li>
            </ol>
